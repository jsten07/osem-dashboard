# osem-dashboard

Summary of senseBoxes from the [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) visulized as a dashboard with R-shiny. 
Makes use of the [R package opensensmapr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=opensensmapr).

Currently deployed at [shinyapps](https://sten.shinyapps.io/osem-dashboard/).

More proof of concept than serious app as it needs some visual and functional improvements.


# Get started
